As someone who has always been fascinated by computers and the idea of creating, software engineering seemed like a natural transition. Up until recently, I was solely involved in music production as well as audio engineering. I find the satisfaction of turning a vision into a tangible product extremely addictive; I suppose that would explain my interest in software engineering as well. After several months of binging tutorials and inconsistently learning on freecodecamp.org I decided to enroll to FlatIron. The challenge seemed intense and I knew the program would put me on the right path to developing a strong skillset which is priceless in my opinion. I am hopeful for the future and while it's only just begun, I'm certain this was a good decision.
